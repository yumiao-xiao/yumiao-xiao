- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yumiao Xiao, an MPhil student from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou). I received my bachelor's degree in Geography from Beijing Normal University in June 2024.
- ðŸ‘€ My research delves into the fascinating world of global change ecology and vegetation-environment interactions. I am particularly interested in understanding the variations in terrestrial carbon cycle across various spatiotemporal scales, and how these processes are modulated by climate change and anthropogenic activity. Methodologically, I employ many methods such as ecosystem process model, field observation, manipulative experiment, remote sensing, machine learning, spatial statistics and causal inference.
- ðŸŒ± Welcome collaborations and communications, especially in the areas of climate change and ecosystem response in grassland, forest and urban regions.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at yxiao224@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn or xiaoyumiao2023@163.com.
